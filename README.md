If you are reading this you are a 10xer make a pull request to 
<a href="https://github.com/LegitTalon/10xers/blob/gh-pages/_data/xers.yml">xers.yml file in the _data folder</a> of this repo.

just add a line like this:

- name: YOURNAME
  url: A LINK TO SOMETHING

I shouldn't have to say this but this repo is _satirical_.
